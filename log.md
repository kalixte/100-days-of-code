# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 01, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Today, my goal is to complete Section 1 of the Modern React/Redux course by Stephen Grider on Udemy.

**Today's Goal**: Today, I learned about Dialog Flow and how to implement it in my Facebook Messenger Bot project that I'm working on.

### Day 4: November 05, 2018

**Today's Goal**: I completed W3School's JavaScript exercise from Question 1 to Question 10. I implemented a calculator, sorted an array and just core JS fundamentals.

**My Thought's**:

### Day 5: November 06, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Successfully built and deployed my first Facebook Messenger chatbot, powered by Dialog Flow with Node JS and Express. 

**My Thought's**:
