# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 01, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Today, my goal is to complete Section 1 of the Modern React/Redux course by Stephen Grider on Udemy.

**My Thought's**: I've been developing with React for 3 months but I'm still rather weak with statements and components. Section 1 acts as a great refresher on concepts such as JSX, States and Component Structures.

### Day 1: November 02, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Today, I learned about Dialog Flow and how to implement it in my Facebook Messenger Bot project that I'm working on.

**My Thought's**: I've always wanted to challenge myself by building a chatbot, a friend introduced me to Dialog Flow by Google that acts as an alternative to learning NLP for the sake of this project. The chatbot would probably take a week to complete.
